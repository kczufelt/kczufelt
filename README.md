# 👋 Hi, I'm Ken Zufelt

**Independent researcher developing Token-Architected Intelligence (TAI)** — a structured AI cognition framework focused on:

- deterministic reasoning  
- governed memory systems  
- stable identity and temporal coherence  
- interpretable, auditable decision pathways  

All technical details that may relate to proprietary mechanisms are **IP Hidden** until formal peer review.

## 🔬 Current Focus: Token-Architected Intelligence (TAI)

TAI is an architectural proposal exploring how to build:

- predictable, verifiable cognitive processes  
- structured memory governance  
- safe training and containment environments  
- agent-based reasoning components  
- cross-modal token integration  

Specific mechanisms and routing structures are **IP Hidden**.

My current objective is to prepare the consolidated TAI documents for expert peer evaluation by qualified researchers in AI systems, cognitive architectures, and world-model-focused work.

## 📄 Research Areas

- Deterministic cognition  
- Memory governance and provenance  
- Safe learning architectures  
- Multi-agent cognitive systems  
- Temporal reasoning  
- Multimodal training pathways  

(Technical implementations are **IP Hidden**.)
