# 👋 Hi, I'm Ken Zufelt

**Independent researcher developing Token-Architected Intelligence (TAI):  
a deterministic, safety-first approach to structured cognition.**

My work focuses on clean architectural principles rather than scale:  
governed memory systems, predictable behavior, and interpretable reasoning.

---

## 🧩 **What I Work On**

- Deterministic routing and controlled reasoning pathways  
- Governed memory architectures with traceability  
- Structured knowledge representations with persistent identity  
- Temporal coherence frameworks  
- Safe learning and containment environments  

_(Technical details intentionally withheld for IP protection.)_

## 📜 **Recent Work**

- Consolidated a multi-document technical specification for TAI (947+ pages)  
- Developed prototype tests demonstrating controlled perceptual matching  
- Built early structural frameworks for deterministic recall pathways  
- Designed VR-based containment and safe learning zone concepts  
- Preparing peer-review–ready documents for external researchers

## 🎯 **Why TAI?**

Much of today’s AI is built on probabilistic inference systems whose internal state  
does not persist, cannot be governed, and is difficult to audit.

My work explores an alternative direction:  
**architectures where identity, memory governance, and reasoning paths  
are explicit, inspectable, and built to be deterministic from the start.**

This focus aligns with emerging needs in safety, interpretability, and cognitive science.

Some aspects of TAI (mechanisms, schemas, and internal architectures)  
are intentionally omitted from this public profile for IP protection  
until formal review pathways are established.
